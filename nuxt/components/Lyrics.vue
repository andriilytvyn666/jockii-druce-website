        At the bus stop, crushing rocks<br />
        (Crush, crush, crush, crush, C-c-crush, crush)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They all stare at me, I don’t care at all<br />
        (Oh my god, fuck you)
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong<br />
        (What, what the fuck are you looking at?)
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Every day go the same, got to stay strong<br />
        (Trust, trust, trust, trust me it gets so much worse)
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Something feels so wrong<br />
        It’s the way I look or the way I walk<br />
        Why are you scared of me when I’m not so hard?<br />
        No peroxide, I stay dark<br />
        Don’t go around him, you might get robbed<br />
        Chop off your body parts<br />
        Chop his arm off and take his watch
      </p>
